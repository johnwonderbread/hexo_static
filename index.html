        <p>Under current rules, the party that finds itself in the minority after the census can expect to lose seats next time around. Over time, if this happens multiple decades in a row, legislative districts become very favorable to one party and ultimately allow extreme ideologies to take place in the legislature without fear of being held accountable by voters.</p>
<p>As district lines become more extreme so does our dialogue and so do our politicians, which results in less compromise on the many major problems facing our country. This is what is meant when it is said that campaign finance is reshaping America.</p>
<p>When redistricting creates “safe” districts, donors fund the favored candidate in hopes that their voices may be considered once that person is in office. The increase in fundraising then empowers the party in power to pursue and contend less favorable seats since they don’t have to defend the safe ones. Fast forward to the next decade and another census is conducted, new districts are drawn by that party and the cycle repeats.</p>
<p>This type of politics encourage outcomes that are fundamentally undemocratic. Ohio has some of the strongest Republican districts in the nation but this sort of thing also happens in states like Maryland where district lines heavily favor Democrats. Earlier in 2019, the U.S. Supreme Court dealt a fierce blow to those challenging this type of rigging in <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/18pdf/18-422_9ol1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rucho v. Common Cause</a> when they declined to intervene and left the issue to states to handle – the same states with rigged legislative elections.</p>
<p>Let’s continue our use of Ohio as an example. The last nine people to win the Presidency did so by first winning the popular vote in Ohio. Since 1864, Ohioans have voted in favor of the winning candidate for President 89% of the time. Presidents Grover Cleveland (1884, 1892), FDR (1944) and JFK (1960) are the only three to break this trend.</p>
<p>State government in the Buckeye state has taken a decidedly different appearance over the last 25 years. In 2018, Republican candidates won Governor, all other statewide elections and 62% of Statehouse legislative seats. Today, Republicans control 24 of 32 seats in the State Senate and 61 of 99 seats in the Ohio House.</p>
<p>Common sense says a larger number of Ohioans supported Republicans in 2016 during a red wave that propelled Trump to D.C. and presumably again during the 2018 mid-terms. Rust belt voters like <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/20/us/politics/trump-voters-job-layoffs.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">those in Youngstown</a> are the target demographic of a presidential campaign focused on voters abandoned by a Democratic party supposedly out of touch with the needs of working-class people. Even the union bosses are telling Democratic candidates to save their breath.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>About 40 percent of the union autoworkers at the General Motors plant in Lordstown, Ohio, voted for Mr. Trump, which was twice the support for Republican presidential candidates in the past, said Tim O’Hara, vice president of United Auto Workers Local 1112, which represents the factory.</em></p>
<p><em>Mr. O’Hara advised Democratic presidential candidates not to waste breath trying to win back union voters who supported Mr. Trump.</em></p>
<p><em>“I don’t think those Trump people are going to flip back, even if it’s Joe Biden, who has a lot of support in this area,” he said. “I think they’re dug in on Trump. Whatever happens, they’re going to go down with the ship with him.”</em></p>
<p><em>Gabriel, Trip (2019, May 19) There’s No Boom in Youngstown, but Blue-Collar Workers Are Sticking With Trump Retrieved from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/20/us/politics/trump-voters-job-layoffs.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NY Times</a></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>But common sense can be misleading. 49% of Ohioans voted for Democratic candidates in 2018. How do we explain the gap between ballots cast and the party affiliation of people elected to office?</p>
<p>In many states – including Ohio in 2000 and 2010 – there is a legislative process for redistricting to determine the shape of districts after the census. States must redraw districts every decade to reflect the census and changing populations (this is at the center of the Trump administration’s desire to add a <a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/7/11/20689015/census-citizenship-question-trump-executive-order" target="_blank" rel="noopener">citizenship question</a>).</p>
<p>If one party controls the House, Senate and Governor’s seat while drawing new lines that party wields all of the power in determining the lines for each elected seat – both in state legislatures and Congress. This was the case in Ohio in both 2000 and 2010 and will remain the case even with the passage of a ballot initiative that reformed redistricting processes.</p>
<p>You may be familiar with the term “Gerrymandering,” where districts are drawn in a way that favors one party. Essentially, carving up communities to create a voter map that protects their ideology. With the rise of <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/10/gerrymandering-technology-redmap-2020/543888/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">computing power</a> over the last 20-30 years the ability to model a district that favors a particular party has never been easier or <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-maps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more precise</a>.</p>
<p>So, what do census elections and redistricting have to do with campaign finance?</p>
<p><img src="/chartdata/image4.png" alt="Money Raised by Legislative Campaign in Each Party"></p>
<p>In the elections that took place during and immediately following census years (2000, 2002, 2010 and 2012), Republican candidates held a near 2:1 fundraising advantage over their Democratic counterparts. Generally, the majority party does better in fundraising as lobbyists and donors vie for influence. This is even more true when the majority party holds an inherit advantage in the way the maps are drawn as challengers to the seat are even less likely to win.</p>
<p>In control of the House, Senate, and all statewide offices Republican lawmakers were in complete control and able to draw lines however they wanted in both 2000 and in 2010. In both cases, these lines would be in place for the decade that followed.</p>
<p><img src="/chartdata/image3.png" alt="Votes Received by and Seats Won by Each Party"></p>
<p>The immediate effect during each census year and in the year that followed, as can be seen in the graph above, is that the number of ballots cast statewide and the number of seats held by each party are not equal. Across all four elections, Republican candidates won ~53% of the vote but ~62% of legislative races.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, this phenomena also is occurring in Maryland, North Carolina and elsewhere as parties vie for power in critical redistricting years and subsequently give themselves a fixed advantage for the years that follow. This advantage grows larger as campaign finance rules are softened and moneyed interests can help provide a launching pad for special interests that benefit those few with the financial resources available to contribute. The only way this cycle is broken is if the party in power agrees to eliminate unfair election rigging and in doing so eliminate their own built in electoral advantage.</p>

        <p>As we explore state-level campaign finance, there’s a temptation to figure out what is normal. What does a typical state campaign finance system look like? How big is it? How does it break between the various parties? What is the size of PAC contributions, big donors, small donors?</p>
<p>If we recognize at the start of this project that fundamental problems exist at all levels of the campaign finance system, then normal isn’t a term we want to use. Still, there are common factors that make sense to understand through example – a state that’s not too big, not too small (but juuuuust right) – that helps us point out the important parts and serves as a benchmark for what we are examining. Here is where I humbly submit the great state of Ohio.</p>
<p>As America’s bellwether, <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/columbus-ohio-test-market-of-the-usa/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">favorite testing market</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_states_and_territories_of_the_United_States_by_population" target="_blank" rel="noopener">7th most populous state</a>, I would argue that it has a robust mix of the kinds of demographics we will see in many other states. The state is both rural Appalachian and rural Midwestern. It contains Cleveland, a prominent rustbelt center and Cincinnati, a distinctly southern city. At the same time, the population is large enough to include many of the big businesses, donors and out-of-state contributions that we’re interested and examining. More importantly, Ohio is theoretically a purple state, having gone to George W. Bush twice, Obama twice, and Trump once.</p>
<p>However, Ohio isn’t a perfect model and it would be disingenuous of me not to also point out some of the asterisks. The state is whiter than average for the US and has almost no <a href="https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/OH" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hispanic population</a>. Median household income is also below the national average and its African American child mortality rate is <a href="https://www.cleveland.com/healthfit/2018/12/ohio-infant-deaths-in-2017-second-lowest-on-record-disparity-rises.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">increasingly higher</a> than children of other races. It’s also not the sexiest state in terms of business concentration, sports team franchises or seafood options. Also, Ohio is theoretically purple. Barring a flip in 2006, the state’s legislature and governor’s mansion have been dominated by a single party since the 90s.</p>
<p>Indeed, if normal exists, Ohio isn’t it, but it’s as good a starting place as any. So what can we learn from Ohio just at a glance?</p>
<p>The U.S. Census Bureau estimates that Ohio’s population in 2018 was 11.69 million people. About 9 million (77.8%) of that population was estimated to be age 18 or older. Most of these adults, between 7 million and 8 million, were registered voters during the last four general elections.</p>
<p><img src="/chartdata/image1.png" alt="Recent Voter Turnout"><br><em>Source: Ohio Secretary of State election results.</em></p>
<p>While turnout for the 2016 election was around 70% of registered voters, non-presidential years see dramatically lower numbers. 2017, a year with no congressional, general assembly and very few city council races (but a plethora of local ballot issues) saw approximately 32% of eligible voters cast a ballot.</p>
<p>At the same time, the number of donors in a given cycle are far lower – barely a blip compared to total registered voters.</p>
<p><img src="/chartdata/image2.png" alt="Recent Voter Turnout"></p>
<p>In 2018, the state of Ohio captured 254,133 contributions (about 2.8% of the number of eligible voters) to various political campaigns. For the sake of simplicity, I’ve excluded political party and political action committee (PAC) donations. I also think there’s something rather ideal about a person caring enough to give money directly to a candidate.</p>
<p>This data comes with a lot of other caveats. Many donors are not Ohio residents, some donors gave more than once or jointly as a couple, and many donations are in kind contributions – goods and services rather than cash. The list goes on. Broadly speaking, there are two takeaways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Most eligible Ohioans don’t vote unless the president is on the ballot.</li>
<li>A very, very small number of people are responsible for funding all political campaigns.</li>
</ul>
<p>If voting and donating are the bare minimum in political participation (somewhere below volunteering time, organizing events or actually running for office) then most Ohioans choose not to participate. This is even more true where campaign finance is involved. Political campaigns don’t work without money and without the contributions of those ~250,000 donors, democracy as we know it doesn’t happen.</p>
<p>This feature – that the state’s political institutions rest on a small segment of the people – is both something I expect to see in see in other states and an exploitable weakness of our representative system. As we continue to explore Ohio’s campaign finance, we will examine this particular element and look for other features of the campaign finance system.</p>

        <p>The idea of MapChange came to me in the fall of 2018. As Ohio’s election for Governor was at the peak of the race I noticed that very little news coverage discussed the two major party candidate’s fundraising records. Having worked politically in Ohio from 2008-2014 I was familiar with the Secretary of State’s website and how to retrieve campaign finance reports and so I did.</p>
<p>Over the course of a month, I loaded the data into R-studio and explored trends and potential narratives. There were a lot. There were also some issues with the reporting candidates were providing the state’s oversight authority. As I continued to explore the data I started to become more and more intrigued by other races and comparing the campaign contribution and expenditure trends of state representative and senate candidates to statewide candidates like governor, auditor, and others.</p>
<p>As my interest grew, so did my curiosity about the lack of reporting in local media. While a lot of our collective attention is focused on national high-profile elections the truth is state politics has a great deal more to do with our day-to-day lives. From decisions about our schools and local government funding to how we fund education and what our children learn in classrooms.</p>
<p>Campaign finance has been a big deal on the national stage for years now and especially since the US Supreme Court’s ruling on Citizen’s United in 2010. However, despite all of the national attention, how candidates are funded in state elections – the elections that most directly effect the most Americans – aren’t getting the same level of attention.</p>
<p>Partially, I think this has to do with the national focus of media outlets that have the resources to attack these types of stories. Many newspapers today are struggling and the world of data journalism just isn’t a part of their storied histories or staffing. Importantly, while Ohio’s data is fairly well curated and accessible online, other states aren’t as as far along in how they treat public accessibility to campaign finance filings.</p>
<p>From all of this, the idea of MapChange was born. A project dedicated to retrieving, cleaning, and maintaining detailed campaign contribution data in states all across the country and leveraging that data to explore interesting trends and stories that are reshaping our country’s statehouses. Central to this idea is how special interest donations, high-profile donors, and the rules governing election funding are changing the makeup of our state legislatures. The people elected in these races ultimately have the final say on the redistricting process. The age of computers and sophisticated modeling has enabled gerrymandering at a level of precision unimaginable just decades ago. The stakes are higher than they have ever been.</p>
<p>MapChange is the intersection of these ideas: campaign finance, the importance of state-level elections, and the manner in which election outcomes change redistricting.</p>
<p>Many details surrounding this project are still being worked through. In the future, we will share more information with regards to our mission and what you can expect from this project moving forward. Additionally, in the coming weeks and months, we will be working toward creating tools to empower more people to easily access state-level campaign finance data in order to better inform conversations happening all over the country.</p>
<p>Thank you for being here from the start and we look forward to taking this journey with you. More to come.</p>
