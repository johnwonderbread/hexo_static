        <p>Under current rules, the party that finds itself in the minority after the census can expect to lose seats next time around. Over time, if this happens multiple decades in a row, legislative districts become very favorable to one party and ultimately allow extreme ideologies to take place in the legislature without fear of being held accountable by voters.</p>
<p>As district lines become more extreme so does our dialogue and so do our politicians, which results in less compromise on the many major problems facing our country. This is what is meant when it is said that campaign finance is reshaping America.</p>
<p>When redistricting creates “safe” districts, donors fund the favored candidate in hopes that their voices may be considered once that person is in office. The increase in fundraising then empowers the party in power to pursue and contend less favorable seats since they don’t have to defend the safe ones. Fast forward to the next decade and another census is conducted, new districts are drawn by that party and the cycle repeats.</p>
<p>This type of politics encourage outcomes that are fundamentally undemocratic. Ohio has some of the strongest Republican districts in the nation but this sort of thing also happens in states like Maryland where district lines heavily favor Democrats. Earlier in 2019, the U.S. Supreme Court dealt a fierce blow to those challenging this type of rigging in <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/18pdf/18-422_9ol1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rucho v. Common Cause</a> when they declined to intervene and left the issue to states to handle – the same states with rigged legislative elections.</p>
<p>Let’s continue our use of Ohio as an example. The last nine people to win the Presidency did so by first winning the popular vote in Ohio. Since 1864, Ohioans have voted in favor of the winning candidate for President 89% of the time. Presidents Grover Cleveland (1884, 1892), FDR (1944) and JFK (1960) are the only three to break this trend.</p>
<p>State government in the Buckeye state has taken a decidedly different appearance over the last 25 years. In 2018, Republican candidates won Governor, all other statewide elections and 62% of Statehouse legislative seats. Today, Republicans control 24 of 32 seats in the State Senate and 61 of 99 seats in the Ohio House.</p>
<p>Common sense says a larger number of Ohioans supported Republicans in 2016 during a red wave that propelled Trump to D.C. and presumably again during the 2018 mid-terms. Rust belt voters like <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/20/us/politics/trump-voters-job-layoffs.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">those in Youngstown</a> are the target demographic of a presidential campaign focused on voters abandoned by a Democratic party supposedly out of touch with the needs of working-class people. Even the union bosses are telling Democratic candidates to save their breath.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>About 40 percent of the union autoworkers at the General Motors plant in Lordstown, Ohio, voted for Mr. Trump, which was twice the support for Republican presidential candidates in the past, said Tim O’Hara, vice president of United Auto Workers Local 1112, which represents the factory.</em></p>
<p><em>Mr. O’Hara advised Democratic presidential candidates not to waste breath trying to win back union voters who supported Mr. Trump.</em></p>
<p><em>“I don’t think those Trump people are going to flip back, even if it’s Joe Biden, who has a lot of support in this area,” he said. “I think they’re dug in on Trump. Whatever happens, they’re going to go down with the ship with him.”</em></p>
<p><em>Gabriel, Trip (2019, May 19) There’s No Boom in Youngstown, but Blue-Collar Workers Are Sticking With Trump Retrieved from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/20/us/politics/trump-voters-job-layoffs.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NY Times</a></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>But common sense can be misleading. 49% of Ohioans voted for Democratic candidates in 2018. How do we explain the gap between ballots cast and the party affiliation of people elected to office?</p>
<p>In many states – including Ohio in 2000 and 2010 – there is a legislative process for redistricting to determine the shape of districts after the census. States must redraw districts every decade to reflect the census and changing populations (this is at the center of the Trump administration’s desire to add a <a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/7/11/20689015/census-citizenship-question-trump-executive-order" target="_blank" rel="noopener">citizenship question</a>).</p>
<p>If one party controls the House, Senate and Governor’s seat while drawing new lines that party wields all of the power in determining the lines for each elected seat – both in state legislatures and Congress. This was the case in Ohio in both 2000 and 2010 and will remain the case even with the passage of a ballot initiative that reformed redistricting processes.</p>
<p>You may be familiar with the term “Gerrymandering,” where districts are drawn in a way that favors one party. Essentially, carving up communities to create a voter map that protects their ideology. With the rise of <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/10/gerrymandering-technology-redmap-2020/543888/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">computing power</a> over the last 20-30 years the ability to model a district that favors a particular party has never been easier or <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-maps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more precise</a>.</p>
<p>So, what do census elections and redistricting have to do with campaign finance?</p>
<p><img src="/chartdata/image4.png" alt="Money Raised by Legislative Campaign in Each Party"></p>
<p>In the elections that took place during and immediately following census years (2000, 2002, 2010 and 2012), Republican candidates held a near 2:1 fundraising advantage over their Democratic counterparts. Generally, the majority party does better in fundraising as lobbyists and donors vie for influence. This is even more true when the majority party holds an inherit advantage in the way the maps are drawn as challengers to the seat are even less likely to win.</p>
<p>In control of the House, Senate, and all statewide offices Republican lawmakers were in complete control and able to draw lines however they wanted in both 2000 and in 2010. In both cases, these lines would be in place for the decade that followed.</p>
<p><img src="/chartdata/image3.png" alt="Votes Received by and Seats Won by Each Party"></p>
<p>The immediate effect during each census year and in the year that followed, as can be seen in the graph above, is that the number of ballots cast statewide and the number of seats held by each party are not equal. Across all four elections, Republican candidates won ~53% of the vote but ~62% of legislative races.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, this phenomena also is occurring in Maryland, North Carolina and elsewhere as parties vie for power in critical redistricting years and subsequently give themselves a fixed advantage for the years that follow. This advantage grows larger as campaign finance rules are softened and moneyed interests can help provide a launching pad for special interests that benefit those few with the financial resources available to contribute. The only way this cycle is broken is if the party in power agrees to eliminate unfair election rigging and in doing so eliminate their own built in electoral advantage.</p>
