        <p>As we explore state-level campaign finance, there’s a temptation to figure out what is normal. What does a typical state campaign finance system look like? How big is it? How does it break between the various parties? What is the size of PAC contributions, big donors, small donors?</p>
<p>If we recognize at the start of this project that fundamental problems exist at all levels of the campaign finance system, then normal isn’t a term we want to use. Still, there are common factors that make sense to understand through example – a state that’s not too big, not too small (but juuuuust right) – that helps us point out the important parts and serves as a benchmark for what we are examining. Here is where I humbly submit the great state of Ohio.</p>
<p>As America’s bellwether, <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/columbus-ohio-test-market-of-the-usa/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">favorite testing market</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_states_and_territories_of_the_United_States_by_population" target="_blank" rel="noopener">7th most populous state</a>, I would argue that it has a robust mix of the kinds of demographics we will see in many other states. The state is both rural Appalachian and rural Midwestern. It contains Cleveland, a prominent rustbelt center and Cincinnati, a distinctly southern city. At the same time, the population is large enough to include many of the big businesses, donors and out-of-state contributions that we’re interested and examining. More importantly, Ohio is theoretically a purple state, having gone to George W. Bush twice, Obama twice, and Trump once.</p>
<p>However, Ohio isn’t a perfect model and it would be disingenuous of me not to also point out some of the asterisks. The state is whiter than average for the US and has almost no <a href="https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/OH" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hispanic population</a>. Median household income is also below the national average and its African American child mortality rate is <a href="https://www.cleveland.com/healthfit/2018/12/ohio-infant-deaths-in-2017-second-lowest-on-record-disparity-rises.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">increasingly higher</a> than children of other races. It’s also not the sexiest state in terms of business concentration, sports team franchises or seafood options. Also, Ohio is theoretically purple. Barring a flip in 2006, the state’s legislature and governor’s mansion have been dominated by a single party since the 90s.</p>
<p>Indeed, if normal exists, Ohio isn’t it, but it’s as good a starting place as any. So what can we learn from Ohio just at a glance?</p>
<p>The U.S. Census Bureau estimates that Ohio’s population in 2018 was 11.69 million people. About 9 million (77.8%) of that population was estimated to be age 18 or older. Most of these adults, between 7 million and 8 million, were registered voters during the last four general elections.</p>
<p><img src="/chartdata/image1.png" alt="Recent Voter Turnout"><br><em>Source: Ohio Secretary of State election results.</em></p>
<p>While turnout for the 2016 election was around 70% of registered voters, non-presidential years see dramatically lower numbers. 2017, a year with no congressional, general assembly and very few city council races (but a plethora of local ballot issues) saw approximately 32% of eligible voters cast a ballot.</p>
<p>At the same time, the number of donors in a given cycle are far lower – barely a blip compared to total registered voters.</p>
<p><img src="/chartdata/image2.png" alt="Recent Voter Turnout"></p>
<p>In 2018, the state of Ohio captured 254,133 contributions (about 2.8% of the number of eligible voters) to various political campaigns. For the sake of simplicity, I’ve excluded political party and political action committee (PAC) donations. I also think there’s something rather ideal about a person caring enough to give money directly to a candidate.</p>
<p>This data comes with a lot of other caveats. Many donors are not Ohio residents, some donors gave more than once or jointly as a couple, and many donations are in kind contributions – goods and services rather than cash. The list goes on. Broadly speaking, there are two takeaways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Most eligible Ohioans don’t vote unless the president is on the ballot.</li>
<li>A very, very small number of people are responsible for funding all political campaigns.</li>
</ul>
<p>If voting and donating are the bare minimum in political participation (somewhere below volunteering time, organizing events or actually running for office) then most Ohioans choose not to participate. This is even more true where campaign finance is involved. Political campaigns don’t work without money and without the contributions of those ~250,000 donors, democracy as we know it doesn’t happen.</p>
<p>This feature – that the state’s political institutions rest on a small segment of the people – is both something I expect to see in see in other states and an exploitable weakness of our representative system. As we continue to explore Ohio’s campaign finance, we will examine this particular element and look for other features of the campaign finance system.</p>
